# Minimal Cookiecutter
A minimalist cookiecutter for new research projects.
It is a template for cookiecutter, a tool for quickly generate template-based new repositories.
In order to use it, you'll need to first install cookiecutter. How:

```bash
# Uncomment this part if you don't have pipx installed
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install pipx
# pipx ensurepath

# Install cookiecutter
pipx install cookiecutter
```

The repo was tested on linux, with uv package and project manager. Both uv and 
cookiecutter should work on Windows and MacOs, but I didn't test it there yet.

Run via `cookiecutter gh:leonardo-agueci/minimal-cookiecutter`
